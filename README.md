Visualization of Dijkstra and A* search algorithms. [explorer-gamma.now.sh/](https://explorer-gamma.now.sh/)

Use the available brushes to see how each algorithm behaves depending on the board.

Note: 
- Path cannot lead diagonally
- A* is using manhattan heuristic function
- Start and destination points must be selected for the algorithm to work
